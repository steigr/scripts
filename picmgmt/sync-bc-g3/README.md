# sync-bc-g3

Thats a script which helps me prepare my pictures-folder for gallery3-module "server_add".
I use BotSync on Android to sync my photos from phone to gallery3-server.
Gallery3 has a module for added pictures directly from server-harddrive.

This script can be used to check which pictures are new and create a import-dir for the server_add-module.
